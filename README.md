## Overview

This project was created to provide a comprehensive view of sales leads activity for my team at Franklin Loan Center. The primary objective was to track, analyze, and visualize the sales leads data to help the sales team make data-driven decisions, improve lead conversion rate and determine where was the best place to spend our advertising dollars.

## Problem Statement

When I first developed this tracking sheet, I aimed to answer several key questions:
- How are our sales leads distributed across different services and stages?
- Which days of the week generate the most leads?
- What trends can we observe in leads generation over time, both weekly and monthly?
- Which lead sources contribute the most to our overall sales funnel?

## Data Analysis

Based on the visualizations and data analysis:

- **Leads Distribution by Service**: The dashboard shows that **YLOPO** is the dominant lead source, contributing 62.5% of total leads, while **CINC** follows at 34.8%. This insight suggests focusing more marketing resources on **YLOPO**-related campaigns, while also exploring strategies to increase leads from other sources such as **CurbHero**.

- **Lead Generation Trends**: Analyzing leads per week and month reveals that lead generation peaks in February, then the summer months June, July, and August. There is a noticeable drop in lead activity in March, April and May, which may indicate seasonal trends or gaps in marketing efforts during these months. The sales team could consider increasing marketing activities or promotional efforts during these slower months to balance lead generation throughout the year.

- **Leads Per Day of the Week**: The data highlights that Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the most productive days for generating leads, with the highest lead counts recorded on these days. In contrast, Sundays and Fridays show lower lead activity. This insight suggests adjusting staffing or resource allocation to maximize engagement and follow-up efforts on high-traffic days.

- **Leads Per Stage**: The high volume of leads in the "New Lead" and "Contact Established" stages compared to the relatively low conversion to later stages like "Closed" or "Lost" indicates potential areas for process improvement. The sales team should enhance follow-up strategies and focus on nurturing leads through the middle stages of the sales funnel to improve conversion rates.

## Tools and Techniques Used

- **Pivot Tables**: Utilized to aggregate data and create dynamic charts and graphs for the dashboard.
- **Dashboard Design**: Created both light and dark themes to cater to different stakeholder preferences and enhance readability.
- **Data Validation**: Implemented dropdown menus to ensure consistent data entry and reduce errors.

## Results and Conclusion

The final dashboard provides actionable insights that directly inform sales strategies. By identifying high-performing lead sources, understanding weekly and monthly trends, and pinpointing areas for improvement in the sales process, stakeholders can make targeted decisions to enhance lead management and conversion. The dashboard effectively serves as a tool for continuous improvement, offering clear visibility into sales activities and performance.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, Excel functions, and dashboard creation, showcasing the ability to transform raw data into valuable business insights that drive strategic decision-making.
